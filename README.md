Proof of concept for dynamically changing logging levels in a running app with the Watchdog library

1. Install Watchdog (https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/)
2. Run watchdog_mod.py
2. Modify logging level in main_mod.py
3. Open my_log.log to see how simple print statements demonstrate dyamically changing logging levels
